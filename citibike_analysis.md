## Where are the bikes
Bikes rides usually begin and end in tourist locations. Additionally, bike sharing is prominent in hubs, places where professionals work and where jobs are located(3). Bike sharing offers commuters an easy and economic way to get to work. It also presents locals with the opportunity to reduce their carbon footprint, increase cardio activity, while simulatenously allowing them to appreciate their community in new ways!

## Where users are going
Biking activity is heavily centered in Manhattan, moves up towards the Bronx, and flows somewhat up northern parts of Brooklyn and west of the Bronx. This area covers more or less about 90 squared miles (out of the 320 square mile total) and is about the same area as Des Moines. Bike rides usually last about 15 minutes. 

#### Demographic Comparison
As of 2019, Des Moines's population is 214,237(4), vastly smaller than New York City's whopping 8,336,817(2). Though having a lower population could mean less rides, it also ensures more manageability with maintenance costs, personnel, and other logistics to consider for expansion to other parts of Iowa. Nonetheless, as Des Moines continues to inevitably grow and develop an attractive tourism model, bike sharing records could show considerable activity and easily become an essential characteristic to the city's flourishing culture.
