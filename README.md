# NYC Citi Bike Analysis 
Bikesharing is a successful business in New York City. In this analysis NYC Citi Bike data from the month of August is gathered and visualized using Tableau to assess the feasibility of starting a bikesharing program in Des Moines, Iowa. Like New York City, Des Moines brings commuters and is a place "infused with sculpture parks, botanical gardens, and a thriving shopping and dining scene"(1).
